<body>

<p>I really think something about something. Lately I've been wondering how I feel about the thing that I used to think a lot about. I haven't thought about it in quite sometime. 
I am not sure if that is indicative of a problem or just a clear sign that I'm normal.</p>
<p>In any case, it should be noted that I'm writing this because I need some text to fill up a widget that is going to be on the screen.
    If this had been an actual blog the content you are viewing would have been meaningful and - if I can brag a little - it would BLOW YOUR FRIGGIN MIND.
</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn't a real post. So we'll have to do what we need to do in order to make this look like a real thing. That is to say, not look like shit.
